# React Babel Plugins

## Objectives

1. Explain how to find Babel plugins
2. Describe a few useful plugins for React development

## Overview

Be sure to touch on the [react](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-react/)
and [es2015](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-es2015/) plugins, which are
basically essential.

But also be sure to mention that these plugins are just groups of other plugins.

For development, [class properties](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-class-properties/)
is super handy, as which basically means why note just use
[preset-stage-1](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-1/)?

The purpose of this reading is not only to get students comfortable with certain
transformations but also to dispel any ideas that these transformations are
"magic" or "just happen" â€” we need to start giving students some tools at this
point for managing their application configurations.
